# OrreryWebApp
An interactive Orrery Web-app built using Three.js to visualize and explore our Solar System. Users can view planets, their orbits, and access detailed information about each celestial body. Created during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, this project aims to make space exploration accessible and engaging for all.
